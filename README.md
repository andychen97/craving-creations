# Craving Creations

A dynamic web application for food lovers to find and organize their recipes.

I wanted to build this project to test my coding skills. Prior to starting the project, I have spent approximately 5-6 weeks learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with concepts of DOM manipulation/AJAX and retrieving data from APIs. It was my first time piecing my knowledge together to create something wonderful.
